# Create Animation System

Design consistent animations and transitions:

1. **Timing Functions**: Custom easing curves for natural motion
2. **Duration Scale**: Consistent animation timing for different interactions
3. **Hover Animations**: Subtle hover effects for interactive elements
4. **Loading Animations**: Spinners, skeleton screens, and progress indicators
5. **Page Transitions**: Smooth navigation between pages/views
6. **Scroll Animations**: Reveal animations triggered by scroll position
7. **Micro-interactions**: Button clicks, form interactions, and feedback
8. **Performance Optimization**: Hardware acceleration and 60fps animations
9. **Accessibility**: Respect for reduced motion preferences
10. **Animation Library**: Reusable animation classes and keyframes

Include performance guidelines and accessibility considerations.

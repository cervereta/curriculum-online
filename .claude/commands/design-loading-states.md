5. **Error States**: User-friendly error messages with recovery options
6. **Lazy Loading**: Progressive image and content loading interfaces
7. **Infinite Scroll**: Loading indicators for continuous scroll experiences
8. **Form Loading**: Loading states for form submissions and validation
9. **Performance**: Efficient animations that don't impact performance
